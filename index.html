            <h2>THE 411 ON SAMPLING</h2>
            <p>"Sampling is a foundation of hip hop music, which emerged when producers in the 1980s began sampling funk and soul records, particularly drum breaks. It has influenced many other genres of music, particularly electronic music and pop. Samples such as the Amen break, the "Funky Drummer" drum break and the orchestra hit have been used in thousands of recordings, and James Brown, Loleatta Holloway, Fab Five Freddy and Led Zeppelin are among the most sampled artists. The first album created entirely from samples, Endtroducing by DJ Shadow, was released in 1996." - <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(music)">Wikepedia Article On Sampling</a> </p>

                <p>"Think (About It)" is a funk song recorded by Lyn Collins and released as a single on James Brown's People Records in 1972. The recording was produced by Brown (who also wrote the song) and features instrumental backing from his band The J.B.'s. It was the title track of Collins' 1972 debut album. The song is very popular for its raw drumbeat dressed with tambourine and multiple background vocals, which suggest the song was recorded altogether in one take, with Jabo Starks playing drums. It peaked at No. 9 on the Billboard Best Selling Soul Singles chart and No. 66 on the Hot 100.[1] Owing to the composition, it became a fan favourite and has been featured on various compilation albums posthumously. In the closing lyrics, Collins sings lines from "Think", which shows that this song was one of the few adaptations of the 5 Royales song that Brown loved to do. "Think (About It)" is among the most sampled songs of all time.<a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Think_(About_It)">Wikepedia Article on Think (About It)</a></p>

                <p>"When the Levee Breaks" is a country blues song written and first recorded by Memphis Minnie and Kansas Joe McCoy in 1929. The lyrics reflect experiences during the upheaval caused by the Great Mississippi Flood of 1927.

                "When the Levee Breaks" was re-worked by English rock group Led Zeppelin as the last song on their untitled fourth album. Singer Robert Plant used many of the original lyrics and the songwriting is credited to Memphis Minnie and the individual members of Led Zeppelin.[1] Many other artists have performed and recorded versions of the song.<a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/When_the_Levee_Breaks">Wikepedia Article on When the Levee Breaks</a></p>

                <p> "Change the Beat" is a song written and recorded by Fab Five Freddy, and one of the most sampled songs in music history.

                At the end of the Side B version, there appears the phrase "Ahhhhh, this stuff is really fresh", spoken through a vocoder. The first and last words are two of the most widely used samples for scratching. According to WhoSampled, a user-generated website cataloging samples, Change the Beat is one of the three most sampled tracks in history, appearing in over 2600 tracks as of 2022.[2] The earliest of which was the 1983 Herbie Hancock single "Rockit", which featured scratching by pioneering DJ and turntablist Grandmixer DXT (then known as GrandMixer D.ST).<a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Change_the_Beat">Wikepedia Article on Change the Beat</a></p>
